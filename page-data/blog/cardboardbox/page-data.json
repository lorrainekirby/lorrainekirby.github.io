I personally use my own Google Home everyday so I was excited to learn that there was a kit to make one yourself.  The kit was easy to set up and explore as a beginner my adding voice interaction to a raspberry pi (microcontroller). In the past, it took expensive hardware, an advanced computer science degree, and a lot of patience to build something like this google home project. Thankfully Google released a simple way to do all this in just under a few hours. It enabled me to learn multiple facets, learn more about AI (specifically natural language processing), simple electronic circuits, sensors, hardware, programming...the list goes on. This is why I love this project - it’s the best bang for your buck to learn multiple concepts in 1 project.  </p>\n<p>The AIY Voice Kit from Google lets me build my own natural language processor and connect it to the Google Assistant or Cloud Speech-to-Text service, allowing me to ask questions and issue voice commands to my programs. All of this fits in a cardboard cube in the palm of my hand, powered by a Raspberry Pi 3.  The step-by-step instructions to build the cardboard shell (“the hardware”) and then install the electronics to assemble your own device. </p>\n<p>Tips:\nIf you do decide to do this, you’ll need a wired keyboard because I had to login to the raspberry pi to connect to the wifi. The program running on the raspberry pi needs to reach Google’s API therefore the needed internet access. You could use a cheap one from Amazon.</p>\n<p>Here’s some pics from the experience...</p>\n<p><img src=\"/aiy1.jpg\" alt=\"starting\">\n<img src=\"/aiy2.jpg\" alt=\"starting\">\n<img src=\"/aiy3.jpg\" alt=\"starting\"></p>","excerpt":"Here’s a fun way to discover the voice recognition world with Google API and various hardware!
